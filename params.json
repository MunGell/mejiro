{"name":"Mejiro","tagline":"Pastebin for your photos","body":"##About Mejiro\r\n\r\nMejiro is a forgetful single-file PHP web app for instant photo publishing. The app features expiration functionality. When enabled, it deletes photos older than a user-defined number of days -- hence the *forgetful* moniker.\r\n\r\n##Features\r\n\r\n* **Simplicity** The entire app consists of a single PHP file (plus a fav icon). Mejiro requires no installation, and it can be deployed on any web server with PHP5 and the GD library.\r\n* **Instant and easy photo publishing** Upload photos, and Mejiro does the rest.\r\n* **Automatic thumbnail generation** Mejiro automatically generates thumbnails for faster preview.\r\n* **Expiration functionality** The app can automatically delete photos older than a specific number of days.\r\n* **Basic EXIF data** The app extracts and displays basic EXIF info for each photo, including aperture, shutter speed, and ISO.\r\n* **IPTC keywords** Mejiro parses IPTC metadata and displays keywords assigned to photos.\r\n* **Display geographical coordinates on OpenStreetMap** For geotagged photos, you can view their exact locations on OpenStreetMap.\r\n* **Optional description** You can add a description to each photo by creating an accompanying *.php* file. The app can also read and display descriptions from the photo's *UserComment* EXIF field.\r\n\r\n##Requirements\r\n\r\n* A web server with PHP5 and the GD library. (Tested with Apache and lighttpd)\r\n* Git (optional)\r\n\r\n##Installation and Usage\r\n\r\n1. Install the required packages. On Debian and Ubuntu, this can be done by running the following command as root: `apt-get install apache2 php5 php5-gd git`\r\n2. In the terminal, switch to the root directory of the server (e.g., */var/www*) and use the `git clone git clone https://github.com/dmpop/mejiro.git` command to fetch the latest source code. Alternatively, you can download the ZIP archive and extract it into the document root of the server.\r\n3. Open the *index.php* file in a text editor and edit settings. This step is optional.\r\n4. Put photos into the *photos* directory (*.jpg*, *jpeg*, *.JPG*, and *.JPEG* files only).\r\n5. Point the browser to *http://127.0.0.1/mejiro/* (replace *127.0.0.1* with the actual IP address or domain name of your server).\r\n\r\nYou can add descriptions to photos by creating accompanying *.txt* files. For example, to add a description to the *F994362-R1-14-15.jpg* photo, create the *F994362-R1-14-15.txt* file containing a short text. You can use HTML markup for formatting the text.\r\n\r\nTo enable the expiration feature, change the *$expire = false;* line in the *index.php* script to *$expire = true;* and specify the desired expiration period by modifying the *$days* variable.\r\n\r\n##Demo\r\n\r\nA [Mejiro demo](http://dmpop.dhcp.io/mejiro/) is available for your viewing pleasure.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
